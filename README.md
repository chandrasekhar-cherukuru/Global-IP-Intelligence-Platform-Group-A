### ✅ Milestone 2: Week 3 & 4 — Search & Integration (COMPLETED)

**Objectives:**
- Integrate WIPO, USPTO, EPO, TMView APIs for global IP data
- Build a robust search UI with advanced filters (keywords, inventor, assignee, jurisdiction)
- Store search results and enable detailed IP asset views for users

#### ✅ Key Features Delivered in Milestone 2

- **Search Page**: Unified search interface for patents and trademarks. (Frontend: `SearchPage.jsx`)
- **Patent Results with Keyword**: Search patents by keyword using `/api/search/all` and `/api/search/source/USPTO|EPO|WIPO`.
- **Full Details of Patent**: View complete patent info via `/api/search/asset/{assetId}` or `/api/search/asset/{source}/{externalId}`.
- **Filters On**: Enable filters (date, jurisdiction, assignee, inventor) for all search types. Filters are sent in the search request to backend APIs.
- **Date Filter Working**: Date range filters (`fromDate`, `toDate`) work for patents (all sources) and are supported in backend via `SearchRequestDto` and API clients.
- **Trademark Filter**: Trademark search (via TMView) supports keyword and assignee filters. (API: `/api/search/all` with `assetType: TRADEMARK`)
- **Search by Inventor**: Patent search supports inventor filter (API: `/api/search/all` with `inventor` field). Not supported for trademarks (UI disables this for trademarks).
- **Search by Assignee**: Both patent and trademark search support assignee filter (API: `/api/search/all` with `assignee` field).

**How it works:**
- Frontend collects all filter values and sends them in the search request to `/api/search/all` or `/api/search/source/{dataSource}`.
- Backend (Spring Boot) receives the request, and for patents, applies all filters (date, jurisdiction, inventor, assignee, etc.) in the API clients and combines results.
- For trademarks, TMView API/Selenium supports keyword and assignee filters; date/jurisdiction filters may be limited by TMView capabilities.
- Full details for any asset are fetched via `/api/search/asset/{assetId}` or `/api/search/asset/{source}/{externalId}`.

**APIs Used:**
- `/api/search/all` — Multi-source search (patents & trademarks)
- `/api/search/source/{dataSource}` — Single-source search
- `/api/search/asset/{assetId}` — Full asset details
- `/api/search/asset/{source}/{externalId}` — Full asset details by external ID

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Search page with filters for patents and trademarks
- ✅ Patent results with keyword, inventor, assignee, date, jurisdiction filters
- ✅ Trademark results with keyword and assignee filters
- ✅ Full details view for any patent or trademark

### ✅ Milestone 3: Week 5 & 6 — Analytics, Reporting & System Logs (COMPLETED)

**Objectives:**
- Implement analytics dashboards for Admin and Analyst roles
- Add reporting features and export options
- Integrate system logging and usage metrics

#### Key Features Delivered in Milestone 3
- **Admin Dashboard Analytics**: Visualizations for user activity, search trends, and system health
- **Analyst Dashboard Analytics**: IP landscape analysis, competitor tracking, and advanced filtering
- **Report Generation**: Export search results and analytics as PDF/CSV
- **System Logs**: Track user actions, API usage, and errors (Backend: `SystemLog`, `SystemLogRepository`, `SystemLogService`)
- **Usage Metrics**: Collect and display system usage statistics for admins
- **Backend Enhancements**: Improved error handling, logging, and monitoring

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Real-time analytics dashboards for Admin and Analyst
- ✅ Exportable reports for search and analytics
- ✅ System logs and usage metrics for monitoring
